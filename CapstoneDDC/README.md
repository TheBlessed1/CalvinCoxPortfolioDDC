This is the capstone project worked on for the last
3-4 weeks of our time at Deep Dive Coders. I
recognize that many things are incomplete,
but they still work as proofs of concept.
I want to draw attention to the logo I designed,
the responsive/adaptive layout, the two step-verification for signups and login,
class creation, and MySQL communication.
